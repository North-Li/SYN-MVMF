## SYN-MVMF: A multi-view multi-focus dataset rendered by Blender software

SYN-MVMF consists of 600 scenes, each containing 9 RGB multi-view multi-focus(MVMF) images, 9 defocus maps, 9 depth maps, 9 corresponding all-in-focus ground truth images, as well as camera matrices and parameters for each camera pose. We construct two different resolution versions, 1920×1080 and 960×540, to meet the requirements of various tasks. The complete dataset will be released upon publication.
